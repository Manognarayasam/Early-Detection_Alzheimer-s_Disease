## Project Overview
The project involves several key steps:
1. **Data Acquisition**: Utilizing the Alzheimer MRI Dataset from Hugging Face.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for model training, including normalization and augmentation techniques.
3. **Model Development**: Building and training the CNN using TensorFlow and Keras.
4. **Validation and Testing**: Applying cross-validation methods to evaluate model performance.
5. **Ensemble Techniques**: Combining predictions from multiple models to enhance accuracy.

## Data Preparation
Data is first extracted and then preprocessed to fit the input requirements of the CNN. This includes resizing the images, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the dataset to prevent overfitting.

## Model Training
The CNN is trained using TensorFlow with several layers designed to capture the intricate patterns in MRI scans indicative of Alzheimer's disease. Training involves multiple folds to ensure the model's robustness.

## Model Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. An ensemble of different model runs is used to predict on the test set, improving the reliability of the results.
